Project Introduction
The GynaeCare Dashboard is a fully functional, web-based application designed to improve workflow efficiency and patient data management in the gynecology ward of Al-Khidmat Hospital. The system serves as a modern digital replacement for paper-based patient records, enabling doctors and nurses to manage information in real time across shifts and departments. This dashboard provides a streamlined patient entry system where medical staff can record essential details such as patient ID, name, husband‚Äôs name, CNIC number, mobile number, condition (normal or critical), admission time (morning, evening, night), treating doctor‚Äôs name, and assigned bed number. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring quick data entry and retrieval under hospital conditions. One of the key innovations in this project is the integration of voice-to-text input, enabling doctors to dictate patient descriptions without needing to manually type. This functionality greatly improves speed and convenience during ward rounds or emergency situations. Multiple voice recognition APIs are integrated to support this feature, providing accurate and fast transcription directly into the patient notes section. To ensure the safety of critical cases, the system includes an automated alert mechanism. Patients marked as ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù are highlighted visually and trigger recurring alerts every 30 minutes, displaying the patient‚Äôs name, time of admission, and responsible doctor. This ensures timely monitoring and follow-up, even across different staff shifts. Additional modules include a Bed Management System, which allows staff to monitor bed occupancy in real time and assign beds at the point of patient admission, and a Visualization Dashboard, which uses charts to show the number of patients admitted during each shift. This aids in decision-making and resource allocation across morning, evening, and night teams. The frontend of the project is developed using React.js, offering a dynamic, component-based UI with real-time updates and reusable design patterns. The backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js, which handles API requests, manages patient records, and ensures secure data handling. The voice integration uses external speech recognition APIs, making the system highly responsive and intuitive for doctors. In conclusion, the GynaeCare Dashboard stands as a practical, real-world healthcare solution that leverages modern web technologies to support efficient patient care. It enhances communication between staff, improves data accuracy, and ensures that critical patient information is never missed‚Äîall while providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

ü©∫ Key Features
1. Patient Registration with Complete Details
Doctors and staff can enter full patient information including ID, name, CNIC, mobile, husband‚Äôs name, assigned doctor, shift, and bed number. This ensures complete, standardized admission records.

2. Voice-to-Text Integration
A voice input button allows doctors to dictate notes using speech recognition, saving time during rounds or emergencies by eliminating manual typing.

3. Critical Case Alerts
Patients marked as ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù trigger automatic alerts every 30 minutes, helping staff respond promptly regardless of shift changes.

4. Real-Time Bed Management
The dashboard tracks live bed assignments, helping staff avoid double-bookings and manage ward capacity with ease.

5. Shift-Based Visualization
Charts show how many patients are admitted in each shift (morning, evening, night), helping with staffing and scheduling.

6. Doctor Management Panel
Admins can view which doctors are active, assign them to patients, and manage staff more effectively.

7. Search and Filtering
A smart search bar lets staff find patients, doctors, or beds instantly using name, ID, or keywords.

8. Report Exporting
Generate and download reports for patient stats, bed usage, and shift summaries‚Äîuseful for audits or handovers.

9. Analytics & Visualization
The GynaeCare Dashboard includes a built-in analytics module that provides valuable insights into patient admissions and bed occupancy trends. Using visual charts and graphs, this feature helps hospital staff monitor and evaluate operational patterns in real time.

Technology Stack
The GynaeCare Dashboard is developed using a modern web development stack that ensures performance, scalability, and a seamless user experience.

Frontend: React.js
The user interface is built with React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic, component-based web applications. React allows for fast rendering, real-time UI updates, and a modular structure that‚Äôs easy to maintain and extend.

Backend: Node.js with Express.js
The server-side logic and API handling are powered by Node.js and Express.js. This combination provides a lightweight, non-blocking architecture that handles data flow efficiently, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

Voice Recognition: External APIs
For voice-to-text functionality, the project integrates speech recognition APIs, enabling doctors to dictate patient notes directly into the system. This reduces the need for manual data entry and speeds up workflow during clinical tasks.

Visualization: Chart.js
To present patient data in a visual format, the system uses Chart.js‚Äîa simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library. It allows real-time rendering of bar and line graphs for shift-based analysis and bed usage trends.

Conclusion
The GynaeCare Dashboard successfully addresses the operational and communication challenges faced by doctors and nurses in gynecology wards. By replacing paper-based records with a responsive, voice-enabled digital system, it improves data accuracy, reduces documentation time, and ensures continuity of care across shifts. With integrated features like real-time patient tracking, voice-to-text input, critical case alerts, and shift-based analytics, the system empowers healthcare professionals to make faster, data-driven decisions. Its adaptability to both Server storage and cloud environments also makes it accessible for hospitals of varying sizes and resources. Designed with real hospital workflows in mind, GynaeCare Dashboard is not just a software project‚Äîit is a practical healthcare solution built to enhance patient care, staff efficiency, and long-term digital transformation in Hospital settings.
